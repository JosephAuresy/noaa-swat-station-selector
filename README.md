# 🌧️ NOAA GHCND Station Selector for SWAT+

> **A Streamlit app for hydrologists and watershed modelers.**  
> Upload any watershed shapefile → automatically find, filter, and download the best NOAA climate stations → export SWAT+-ready `.pcp` and `.tmp` files in one click.

## Why this tool?

Choosing the right climate stations is one of the most critical and time-consuming steps in a SWAT+ modeling workflow. A station with 40% missing data or no overlap with your calibration window introduces errors that **no parameter tuning can fix**.

This app automates the entire process:

| Step | What it does |
|---|---|
| **1. Upload** | Load your watershed shapefile (`.shp + .shx + .dbf + .prj`) |
| **2. Parameters** | Set buffer, calibration window, quality thresholds |
| **3. Results** | Automatically downloads NOAA stations, scores them, thins spatially |
| **4. Analysis** | Per-station data quality, missing data heatmaps, climate trends, Mann–Kendall, calibration optimizer |
| **5. Export** | One-click export of all SWAT+ climate files (`.pcp`, `.tmp`, `.cli`, `weather-sta.cli`, `.shp`) |

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/JosephAuresy/noaa-swat-station-selector.git
cd noaa-swat-station-selector

# 2. Install dependencies (Python 3.10+)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run
streamlit run app.py
```

## NOAA API Token

This app queries the **NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO) API** to download station metadata and daily records. A free token is required.

**Get your free token here (30 seconds):**  
👉 https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token

Paste it in the app when prompted. The token is never saved to disk.

## Station scoring algorithm

Each candidate station receives a composite **quality score** (0–1):

```
score = 0.4 × span_norm          # longer record = better
      + 0.4 × cover_frac         # covers more of your calibration window = better
      + 0.2 × recency_norm       # still active recently = better
```

When two stations are within the minimum spacing distance, the one with the **higher score is kept** — thinning is never random.

## Output files

After running the export step you get a `.zip` with:

```
swatplus_climate/
├── GHCND_USC00123456.pcp     # Daily precipitation per station
├── GHCND_USC00123456.tmp     # Daily TMAX / TMIN per station
├── pcp.cli                   # Index of all .pcp files
├── tmp.cli                   # Index of all .tmp files
├── weather-sta.cli            # Station list (lat / lon / elev) for SWAT+
└── stations.shp              # Point shapefile of selected stations
```

Missing values are written as `-99.0`, which tells SWAT+ to use the weather generator — no manual gap-filling needed.

### How to use in SWAT+

1. Unzip the downloaded package
2. Copy all `.pcp` and `.tmp` files → `Scenarios/Default/TxtInOut/`
3. Copy `pcp.cli`, `tmp.cli`, `weather-sta.cli` → same folder
4. In **SWAT+ Editor**: *Climate → Weather Stations → import `weather-sta.cli`*
5. Load `stations.shp` in **QGIS / QSWAT+** to verify spatial coverage
